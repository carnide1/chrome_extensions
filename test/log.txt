Documentation of test
-> the idea here is to create a boring extension first and write down useful commands and steps
-> currently just following the chrome website how to create
-> https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world

- created a manifest file, im assuming it tells chrome what to open 

{
    "name": "Hello Extensions",                     <- name of the extension
    "description": "Base Level Extension",          <- text that describes the extension on google chrome
    "version": "1.0",                               <- tracks your extensionâ€™s version, increment it when making updates
    "manifest_version": 3,                          <- just eh manifest version, important for chrome
    "action": {                                     <- what gets executed im assuming
      "default_popup": "hello.html",                <- this is the code that runs when you do the extension, it just prints it out i guess
      "default_icon": "hello_extensions.png"        <- this is the image when you pin it, the icon for the extension
    }
}

-> the very basics of this extension is that the json file seems to be the point of access for the extension, and then it 
    directs google to the relevant files to the extension. 

-> you can reference js files as well, probably to create new funcitonality
